"""Dispatcher pattern implementation.

A Dispatcher is a class made extensible through callback registration.

One can register callbacks to indexable keys inside the dispatcher *class*, and
use a dispatcher *instance* to dispatch a key and get the corresponding
callback.

The Dispatcher mixin class defined in this module implementsÂ this common
pattern, with the following non-trivial features:

    - If a class inherits from a Dispatcher, it also inherits from its
      callbacks.
    - A sub-class of a Dispatcher can overload its inherited callbacks without
      interfering with the base class's callbacks.
    - A Dispatcher proposes syntaxic sugar with a @Dispatcher.register
      decorator to make its usage nicer and less invasive.
